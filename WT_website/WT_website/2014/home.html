<h2>Bookstores Today:</h2>
Bookstore is the used bookstore or second-hand bookshop which buys and sells
 used and out-of-print books in a variety of conditions. A range of titles are available in used bookstores, 
including in print and out of print books. Book collectors tend to frequent used book stores. Large online bookstores offer used books for sale, too. 
Individuals wishing to sell their used books using online bookstores agree to terms outlined by the bookstore(s): for example,
 paying the online bookstore(s) a predetermined commission once the books have sold.
Bookstores may be either part of a chain, or local independent bookstores.
Bookstores can range in size offering from several hundred to several hundred thousands of titles. They may be brick-and-mortar stores or internet only stores or a combination of both.
 Sizes for the larger bookstores exceed half a million titles.
Bookstores often sell other printed matter besides books, such as newspapers, magazines and maps; additional product lines may vary enormously, particularly among independent bookstores. 
Colleges and universities often have their own student bookstore on campus that focuses on providing course textbooks and scholarly books, although some on-campus bookstores are owned by large chains such as WHSmith or Waterstone's in the United Kingdom, or Barnes & Noble College Booksellers in the United States, which is a private firm controlled by the chair of Barnes & Noble
